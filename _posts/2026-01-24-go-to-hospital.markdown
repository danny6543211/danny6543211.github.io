Today I go to hospital because the last week sinusitis(鼻窦炎). Doctor say there are cyst(囊肿) in my sphenoid sinus(蝶窦). So I need to check if it is good or bad. It was a very special experience for my MRI(核磁共振) scan. When I entered the examination roon, I heard a repetitive rhythmic music. I am confused why there are music here. I thought they were just playing music they liked. Then she told me to lie down, and I was pushed into that MRI machine. Then the machine started making a really loud noise. It was a strange, sharp sound that kept repeating, and it would pause for a every amost twenty seconds. When the machine stopped, I could hear that original melody again. This melody let me know that a little more time had passed. Finally, after what felt like ages, the scan was finally over. I never expected that the music from the start could make this time less boring. Because I could keep waiting to hear when that music would come back again.
